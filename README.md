# Play Drums With Keys
#### (A step towards comforting visually impaired people to play drums with keyboard)
---
KeyDrumPlay is a web application that uses key presses for playing drum tunes. It is very helpful for visually impaired people who can play drums with keyboard.

It's a simple VanillaJS application that triggers the following events:
- `keydown`
-- Triggers when the user presses a key. It repeats while the user keeps the key pressed.
- `keyup`
-- Triggers when the user releases a key, after the default action of that key has been performed.

This web application works on 26 alphabets (character keys, `a, b, c, ..., z`). Each alphabet is mapped with a drum sound and it plays when the key is pressed.

`HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, VanillaJS`
